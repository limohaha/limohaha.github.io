  I am a 5th year PhD student at the Department of Statistical Sciences and Operations Research, Virginia Commonwealth University. My research interest is Changepoint Detection in both Continuous and Discrete Time Series. I am interested in learning more about state-of-the-art statistical modeling and statistical learning methods, and applying them to solve real world problems.

  Basketball, Hiking and Travelling are all my favorite habits.
